Kingston is a small village (1 pub) near the historical town of Lewes in East Sussex. There are a few AirBnB's and bed a breakfasts in Kingston, however we recommend you stay in Lewes (or Brighton) to explore some great places. 

It is a 10minute taxi ride (grab a taxi outside the station in Lewes) or an Uber, and it costs around £7 to get to Kingston Primary School (which is close to our house)

It takes about 40mins to walk to our house from the station (there are some great tracks and stuff to explore on the way)
